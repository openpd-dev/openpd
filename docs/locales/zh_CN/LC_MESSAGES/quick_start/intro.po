"OpenPD is completely written and used in Python as we want it to be as "
"flexible and extensible as possible. When we use a python module, we can "
"also call a gazillion of third-party modules, like numpy, scipy, to make "
"our simulation and analysis more convenient and powerful. Meanwhile, the "
"python package's install is more light-weighted than :math:`c^{++}` or "
":math:`fortran` package."

"This code paradigm is very different from the other well-known simulation"
" package whose input files focus more on determining simulation "
"parameters. The OpenPD will only provide the package and class, leaving "
"work and free to the users."
